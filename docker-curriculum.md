# Docker Curriculum 

Docker is an open source project that lets you package, ship, and deliver your app in a standardized way through `containers`.

Containers are a standard unit of software that packages up code.. and that codes dependencies so that the app runs efficently and reliably across multiple environments.

From Docker's website:

```
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
