## Classes

In ruby a typical class might look like this:

```ruby
class Player
  def initialize(name, team, salary)
    @name = name
    @team = team
    @salary = salary
  end

  def pass
    #method code goes here
  end

  def shoot
    #method code goes here
  end
end
```

In Javascript this would look like:

```javascript
// js constructor function is similar to ruby initialize method
function Player(name, team, salary) {
  this.name = name;
  this.team = team;
  this.salary = salary;
};

// add methods to class
Player.prototype.pass = function() {
  // code goes here
}; 

// create new instance
const steph = new Player('Steph Curry', 'Warriors', 50);

// We can now use our method
steph.pass();
```
