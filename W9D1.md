## API

The Application Programming Interface is a published set of rules for how a piece of software works.

Example:

The ruby object api is the available methods we can use on said object.

## Web Service

A web service returns raw data (JSON), as opposed to assets which could be rendered by the browser (a website). 

Many websites (like google maps), need to use a web service. Gmail is another example of a single page application that constantly shows you new info, without changing the page, by making requests to the api or web service.

## HTTP Request/Response

Client ==> makes HTTP request to ==>  Server

Server recieves the request and sends an HTTP response.

1. **Requests:**

* Has a method: (`GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `POST`, etc)
* Has a path: `/users/4`
* Could have a query string: `?loc=SF&name=`
* Could have a request body: additional data we recieve from forms (we cannot have a body in a GET request)

2. **Response:**

* Returns a status code (200, 404, etc)
* Returns a body (the requested data)

## Rails Routing

When an HTTP request comes from the client to the server, it hits the **router** first. The routers job is to determine which controller to send the request to! It also needs to call the right controller action. It will look at the `path` and the `method` of the request to do this. To clarify:

1. Router recieves HTTP request
2. Checks the routes
3. If it finds a match it will create a new instance of the matching controller
4. It will then call the correct controller action

If a router can't find a matching controller it will throw an error.

## Rails High Level Flow Chart

This is how the rails system flows:

1. Users send an HTTP request to the Router
2. The Router finds the right controller and sends the request to a new instance of that controller and calls the correct action
3. The new controller instance will go through the model
4. The model gets info from the database and returns that to the controller
5. The controller will then either directly give back some JSON to the user (if we are building a web service) or it will send the info to the view so that the view can render that info on the browser (if we are building a full app)

## How To Write A Route

Route example:

```ruby
get 'superheros', to: 'superheros#index'
```

Format:

```ruby
method 'path', to: controller#action
```

## REST Routes

**get returns all of the values for a given resource.** It should always hit the index action of the correct controller. Example:

```ruby
get 'superheros', to: 'superheros#index'
```

**get /:id returns a specific value for the given resource.** It should always hit the show action of the correct controller. Example:

```ruby
get 'superheros/:id', to: 'superheros#show'
```

**post creates a resource.** It should always hit the create action of the correct controller. Example:

```ruby
get 'superheros', to: 'superheros#create'
```

**patch updates a specific resource.** It should always hit the update action of the correct controller. Example:

```ruby
get 'superheros/:id', to: 'superheros#update'
```

**delete destroys a resource.** It should always hit the destroy action of the correct controller. Example:

```ruby
get 'superheros/:id', to: 'superheros#destroy'
```

You can write all seven routes (I've listed the five most used above) like this:

```ruby
resources :posts
```

**It auto generates them. If we don't want all seven we can specify which we want like this:**

```ruby
resources :posts, only: [:index, :show]
```

Remember: We will need to create methods (actions) in our controllers for all routes we create for that controller, so it's best to use this final version I've put in bold.
