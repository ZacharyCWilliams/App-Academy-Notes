## API

The Application Programming Interface is a published set of rules for how a piece of software works.

Example:

The ruby object api is the available methods we can use on said object.

**Web Service**

A web service returns raw data (JSON), as opposed to assets which could be rendered by the browser (a website). 

Many websites (like google maps), need to use a web service. Gmail is another example of a single page application that constantly shows you new info, without changing the page, by making requests to the api or web service.
