## API

The Application Programming Interface is a published set of rules for how a piece of software works.

Example:

The ruby object api is the available methods we can use on said object.

## Web Service

A web service returns raw data (JSON), as opposed to assets which could be rendered by the browser (a website). 

Many websites (like google maps), need to use a web service. Gmail is another example of a single page application that constantly shows you new info, without changing the page, by making requests to the api or web service.

## HTTP Request/Response

Client                                Server

-------                             ----------

Client ==> makes HTTP request to ==>  Server

------                              -----------

Server recieves the request and sends an HTTP response.

1. **Requests:**

* Has a method: (`GET`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `POST`, etc)
* Has a path: `/users/4`
* Could have a query string: `?loc=SF&name=`
* Could have a request body: additional data we recieve from forms (we cannot have a body in a GET request)

2. **Response:**

* Returns a status code (200, 404, etc)
* Returns a body (the requested data)
