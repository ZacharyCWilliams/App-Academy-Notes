## ActiveRecord::Relation

Query methods (joins, select, where, etc.) return a relation object, which looks and behaves just like an array.

## Query's are Lazy

ActiveRecord relation objects are lazy. This means the database queries don't fire off until we actually need them.

## Caching

After the initial query is run, the results are cached by relation! Instead of re-running the same query over and over we can now just use this previously returned result. 

We do this so that we don't have to iterate through the database over and over again for the same info.

Because of this, variables can get "out of date". We can call `reload!` to fix this.

## Joins in Active Record

The SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT
  comments.*
FROM
  comments
JOIN
  users ON users.id = comments.author_id
WHERE
  users.user_name = 'tamboer';
```

is written in rails as:

```ruby
Comment.joins(:author).where(users: { user_name: 'tamboer' })
```

Note: We start with the tables association `class_name`. This is equivalent to SQL's `FROM`.
