## ActiveRecord::Relation

Query methods (joins, select, where, etc.) return a relation object, which looks and behaves just like an array.

## Query's are Lazy

ActiveRecord relation objects are lazy. This means the database queries don't fire off until we actually need them.

## Caching

After the initial query is run, the results are cached by relation! Instead of re-running the same query over and over we can now just use this previously returned result. 

We do this so that we don't have to iterate through the database over and over again for the same info.

Because of this, variables can get "out of date". We can call `reload!` to fix this.

## Joins in Active Record

The SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT
  comments.*
FROM
  comments
JOIN
  users ON users.id = comments.author_id
WHERE
  users.user_name = 'tamboer';
```

is written in rails as:

```ruby
Comment.joins(:author).where(users: { user_name: 'tamboer' })
```

Note: We start with the table associations `class_name`. This is equivalent to SQL's `FROM`.

## Eager Loading

It's better to fetch all comments for posts then it is to fetch each comment one by one for each post (we want to avoid N+1 queries). We do this using `includes`.

Example:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def includes_post_comment_counts
    posts = self.posts.includes(:comments)
    post_comment_counts = {}
    posts.each do |post|
      post_comment_counts[post] = post.comments.length
    end
    post_comment_counts
  end
end
```

Let's break down the above example: 

```ruby
posts = self.posts.includes(:comments)
```

This prefetches the association comments. Because we used `includes` we will prefetch EXTRA data!

```ruby
posts.each do |post|
  post_comment_counts[post] = post.comments.length
end
```

We do not fire a query here since we prefetched this data. We call `.length` instead of `.count` to make use of this prefetched data (`.count` would have us hit the database again).

## Joining Tables To Solve Our N+1 Problem

Eager loading all comments, through `.includes` like we did in the last example, can be wasteful. If we want to know how many comments a post has, we don't need to pull down every single comment. We can just to count how many there are. We can solve this by joining.

```ruby
class User
  def joins_post_comment_counts
    posts_with_counts = self
      .posts
      .select("posts.*, COUNT(*) AS comments_count") 
      .joins(:comments)
      .group("posts.id")

    posts_with_counts.map do |post|
      [post.title, post.comments_count]
    end
  end
end
```
