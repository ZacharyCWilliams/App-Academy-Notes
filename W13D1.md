## Package.json & npm

We use `npm` (node package manager) to generate our `package.json` which is the javascript version of ruby's `gemfile`. 

To initialize a new project (with a package.json file) go into root directory and type:

```
npm init --yes
```

To install specific npm packages through `npm install`. This looks like:

```
npm install react redux
```

^This will automatically add react & redux to your package.json. By running `npm install` people can download your apps dependencies (this makes collaboration easy)

## Webpack

Webpack is a static module bundler that lets you put all of your project dependencies in one file. This keeps your application organized! Instead of requiring many files like this:

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  }
};
```

We can just store all of our required files in a script like this:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
    <script src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Running webpack & npm creates redundant files. This is expensive. To eliminate this we create a `.gitignore` file. We use a trailing `/` to ignore files. Example:

```
# .gitignore

node_modules/
bundle.js
bundle.js.map
```

**We create our webpack file by hand.** Name it `webpack.config.js`.
