## Package.json & npm

We use `npm` (node package manager) to generate our `package.json` which is the javascript version of ruby's `gemfile`. 

To initialize a new project (with a package.json file) go into root directory and type:

```
npm init --yes
```

To install specific npm packages through `npm install`. This looks like:

```
npm install react redux
```

^This will automatically add react & redux to your package.json. By running `npm install` people can download your apps dependencies (this makes collaboration easy)

## Webpack

Running webpack & npm creates redundant files. This is expensive. To eliminate this we create a `.gitignore` file. We use a trailing `/` to ignore files. Example:

```
# .gitignore

node_modules/
bundle.js
bundle.js.map
```

**We create our webpack file by hand.** Name it `webpack.config.js`.
