## Ruby on Rails: Overview

**Why Rails:**

* Easy to deploy to production
* Built off Ruby which is very readable, easy to understand, and a "joy to use" (Beginner friendly)
* Open source framework that has a lot of external libraries (RubyGems)
* Large, active community
* Follows a number of good design principles

## Design Principles  

**MVC**

Rails is a MVC framework! This means it divides an application into a Model, a View, and a Controller.

1. The `Model` retrieves information from storage and performs logic upon that information.
2. The `View` presents information
3. The `Controller` constructs the server's HTTP response and sends commands to the Model to fetch/update information.

Note: The controller is the interface between the model and view. (An **interface** is a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact)

**CoC**

Rails uses convention over configuration. This means that the default configuration is already programmed into the framework, and developers only have to be specific upon doing something unconventional. **This reduces workload!** 

It does this, mainly, through naming conventions! If we name our database table `cats`, the default model name becomes `Cat`, and the default controller becomes `CatsController`. When rails sees these names in conjunction with one another it will automatically know how to load the pieces together.

**REST**

REST, or Representational State Transfer uses standard operations, in combination with particular resources identifiers to produce standardized results.
```
ie. in HTTP, a GET request to a resource with a specified id returns data on the item, regardless of what type of resource/item it is. 
```
Rails uses it's `resources` method which automatically generates `routes` by linking HTTP verbs and URI's to Contoller actions.
