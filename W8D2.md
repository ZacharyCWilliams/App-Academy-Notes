## Ruby on Rails: Overview

**Why Rails:**

* Easy to deploy to production
* Built off Ruby which is very readable, easy to understand, and a "joy to use" (Beginner friendly)
* Open source framework that has a lot of external libraries (RubyGems)
* Large, active community
* Follows a number of good design principles

## Design Principles  

1. **MVC**

Rails is a MVC framework! This means it divides an application into a Model, a View, and a Controller.

1. The `Model` retrieves information from storage and performs logic upon that information.
2. The `View` presents information
3. The `Controller` constructs the server's HTTP response and sends commands to the Model to fetch/update information.

Note: The controller is the interface between the model and view. (An **interface** is a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact)

2. **CoC**

Rails uses convention over configuration. This means that the default configuration is already programmed into the framework, and developers only have to be specific upon doing something unconventional. **This reduces workload!** 

It does this, mainly, through naming conventions! If we name our database table `cats`, the default model name becomes `Cat`, and the default controller becomes `CatsController`. When rails sees these names in conjunction with one another it will automatically know how to load the pieces together.

3. **REST**

The principle behind using REST, or Representational State Transfer is to use standard operations, in combination with particular resource identifiers to produce standard/predictable results. We use these operations to gain access to web resources (documents, images, webpages, etc.)

Example:
```
In HTTP, a GET request to a resource with a specified id returns data 
on the item, regardless of what type of resource/item it is. 
```
Rails uses it's `resources` method which automatically generates `routes` by linking HTTP verbs and URI's to Contoller actions.

## Components

**ActiveRecord**

All models in rails inherit from ActiveRecord. It represents data from our database as Ruby objects, which can then be easily manipulated/presented.

Contains methods which implement basic **Create, Read, Update, Delete** (CRUD) functionality. This mirros SQL queries

**ActionController**

ActionController handles the controller logic. This is where we store information about the session or brief error messages (through cookies). It also checks for authenticity tokens! (This is how we protect against website attacks)

**ActionView**

ActionView renders the view. We will be doing this through ERB (Embedded Ruby) or JSON

**Rack**

Rack sits between the Router and Puma webserver! It recieves requests and generates responses through the information it gets from the router.

**Rake**

A utility tool that we use to carry out administrative tasks (migrating a database, displaying routes, etc).

**Puma**

Puma is a small library that provides a very fast HTTP server for Ruby web applications.

## Competing Frameworks

**Django (Python)**

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

* Ruby was built to be "a joy to use"
* Python was designed around "a clean syntax and code readability"

Simularities:

Both use the MVC design principle. 

Differences:

Instead of using CoC, Python uses an "explicit is better" principle. This makes Django easier to read/understand but a little bit slower to write (No `rails magic`).

## How to start a new rails project

Run `rails new my_project_name -G --database=postgresql`. Rails will now set up the project!

Note: If we just use `rails new FileName` rails will auto default to using a sql3 database.

**Gems we want to add:**

`gem 'pry-rails'`
`gem 'better_errors'`
`gem 'binding_of_caller'`
`gem 'pry-rails'`

After adding gems run `bundle install`.

## Navigating the project

We will be writing the majority of our code in our `app` folder.

**models**

This is where we will be writing our classes that will interact with sql database directly.

**controllers**

This reads the request and figures out what the response will be.

**configuration**

We will create urls in `routes.rb` that will invoke specific controller actions.

**db**

We create all of our migrations, seeds, and schema will be generated inside of `seeds.rb`
