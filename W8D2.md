## Ruby on Rails: Overview

**Why Rails:**

* Easy to deploy to production
* Built off Ruby which is very readable, easy to understand, and a "joy to use" (Beginner friendly)
* Open source framework that has a lot of external libraries (RubyGems)
* Large, active community
* Follows a number of good design principles

## Design Principles  

**MVC**

Rails is a MVC framework! This means it divides an application into a Model, a View, and a Controller.

1. The `Model` retrieves information from storage and performs logic upon that information.
2. The `View` presents information
3. The `Controller` constructs the server's HTTP response and sends commands to the Model to fetch/update information.

Note: The controller is the interface between the model and view. (An **interface** is a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact)
