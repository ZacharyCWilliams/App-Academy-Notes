## CSS Prepocessor

CSS pre-processors extend CSS's functionality with variables, nesting, functions, mixins, operators, and more. They help with style sheet maintenance and allow developers to write DRY-er, more extensible code.

SCSS & Sass are the most widely used CSS preprocessors. We can add SCSS to a file by changing it's extension to `.scss`. They're both ruby based.

## Media Queries

Media Queries are wrappers for CSS code that test if the device running your app meets criteria. Mainly, the criteria is screen width. Although, we can also query device orientation and pixel density!

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) {
  /* Selectors and their styles to apply if condition passes */
}
```

This query (conditional) has two criteria it is looking for:

1. The media type == screen. Check here for a guide on media types => https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/all-stylesheet-media-types/

2. The screen size must be greater than or equal to 480px. 

If we leave off the `screen`, it defaults to all. We also can use multiple conditions. Here's an `and` condition:

```css
@media (min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 980px) {
  /* code goes here */
}
```

and here is an `or` condition:

```css
@media (max-width: 600px), (min-width: 800px) {
  /* code goes here */
}
```

We build media query break points for mobile first, and then work our way up the scale to larger screens. 

```css
.column {
  width: 100%;
}

@media (min-width: 760px) {
  .column {
    float: left;
    width: 50%;
  }
}
```

## Viewport Meta Tag

In order to build a responsive design we are also going to need a viewport meta tag:

```css
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

This goes in the `<head>` tag of our site. It tells the browser to skip some browser-default css customizations (mainly a default width customization).
