## CSS Prepocessor

CSS pre-processors extend CSS's functionality with variables, nesting, functions, mixins, operators, and more. They help with style sheet maintenance and allow developers to write DRY-er, more extensible code.

SCSS & Sass are the most widely used CSS preprocessors. We can add SCSS to a file by changing it's extension to `.scss`. They're both ruby based.
