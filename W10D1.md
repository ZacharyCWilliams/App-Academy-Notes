## Testing With Rails

We test our code to:

* make sure our code works as intended
* reduce necessary refactors
* make collaboration easier
* produce documentation (We NEED our code to be readable)

## Testing Pyramid

``` 
          -
      End To End
        ------
      Integration
    --------------
         Unit
-----------------------
```

They're three types of tests:

* Unit tests make sure that each individual unit of our code works (We write these on Models)
* Integration tests make sure that different parts of our application work together (We write these on Controllers)
* End to end tests the entire front to back end process (We write these on Views)

## Rails Testing: Setup

Navigate to the GemFile and inside of the:

`group :development, :test` section add:

* `gem 'factory_bot_rails'`
* `gem 'faker'`

`group :test,` section add:

* `gem 'rspec-rails'`
* `gem 'capybara'`
* `gem 'shoulda-matchers'`
* `gem 'launchy'`

What these gems do:

* `rspec-rails` gives us the ability to write rspec within our rails application
* `factory_bot_rails` lets us auto-create instances for our tests
* `faker` lets us generate random data for our factory_bot_instances
* `capybara` allows us to test our views or features within our application (simulate user experience)
* `shoulda-matchers` lets us test validations & associations within our models. Also gives us way better error messages
* `launchy` lets us launch external apps inside of our rails app

Once you've added your gems, run `bundle install`.
