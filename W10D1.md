## Testing With Rails

We test our code to:

* make sure our code works as intended
* reduce necessary refactors
* make collaboration easier
* produce documentation (We NEED our code to be readable)

## Testing Pyramid

``` 
          -
      End To End
        ------
      Integration
    --------------
         Unit
-----------------------
```

They're three types of tests:

* Unit tests make sure that each individual unit of our code works (We write these on Models)
* Integration tests make sure that different parts of our application work together (We write these on Controllers)
* End to end tests the entire front to back end process (We write these on Views)
