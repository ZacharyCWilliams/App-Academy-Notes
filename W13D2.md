## Babel 

We use babel to transpile/convert the ES6 Javascript we write to ES5. This version of js is compatible with all browsers that may run your code.

## JSX

JSX is an HTML-lookalike that is transpiled into vanilla javascript through Babel.

Here is an example. This JSX:

```javascript
const quotes = (
	<div className='quotes'>
	  <h1>I love JavaScript!</h1>
	</div>
);
```

Gets transpiled, behind the scenes, into this:

```javascript
const quotes = React.createElement(
  'div',
  { className: 'quotes' },
  React.createElement(
    'h1',
    {},
    'I love Javascript'
  )
);
```

This lets us write really understandable, clean code.

## Component Declaration

We can use either class or functional components. Class components have a lot of boilerplate code under the surface, so it's better to use functional components (React Hooks makes this easier by allowing us to access state inside of functional components). Class Component: 

```javascript

class List extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = { items: [] };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
  // this method is called after the component is rendered onto the DOM
  // and fetches items from the API to be rendered as a list
    $.ajax({
      url: '/items',
      success: items => this.setState({ items });
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
      <ul>
      {
        this.state.items.map(item =>(<li>{item}</li>))
      }
      </ul>
    );
  }
}

```

^We have access to both state and lifecycle events inside of a class component. Here's a functional component:

```javascript
const Message = (props) => {
  return <div>{props.text}</div>
};
```

We can even destructure this functional component (best practice):

```javascript
const Message = ({text}) => {
  return <div>{text}</div>
};
```

^This will be our modus operandi, since we'll be using redux to handle state.

## React Synthetic Events (Event Handlers)

We will pass our event listeners directly to our components via props.

```javascript
const handleClick = event => {
	event.preventDefault();
	alert("clicked!");
};

const SimpleButton = () => (
  <input type="submit" onClick={handleClick}>Click Me!</input>
);
```

^One important thing to note here. We have to use `event.preventDefault();` in order to stop our button from submitting as it normally would. 

## Redux 

Redux is a javascript framework for managing the frontend state of a web app.

Advantages gained from using Redux:

   * It is very **lightweight**; the library only takes up 2 kbs
   * It is very **fast** (the time to insert or retrieve data is low)
   * It is **predictable** (interacting with the data store in the same way repeatedly will produce the same effect)

Redux principles:

   * **A Single Source of Truth:** The state for an entire Redux app is stored in a single, plain JavaScript object.

   * **State is Read Only:** The state object can not be directly modified. Instead it is modified by dispatching actions.

   * **Changes Are Made with Pure Functions:** The reducers that receive the actions and return updated state are pure functions of the old state and the action.
