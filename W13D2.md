## Babel 

We use babel to transpile/covert the ES6 Javascript we write to ES5. This version of js is compatible with all browsers that may run your code.

## JSX

JSX is an HTML-lookalike that is transpiled into vanilla javascript through Babel.

Here is an example. This JSX:

```javascript
const quotes = (
	<div className='quotes'>
	  <h1>I love JavaScript!</h1>
	</div>
);
```

Gets transpiled, behind the scenes, into this:

```javascript
const quotes = React.createElement(
  'div',
  { className: 'quotes' },
  React.createElement(
    'h1',
    {},
    'I love Javascript'
  )
);
```

This lets us write really understandable, clean code.
