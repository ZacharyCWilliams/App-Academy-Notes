## GraphQL

Their website says it best:

```
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime 
for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 
GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description 
of the data in your API, gives clients the power to 
ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it 
easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful 
developer tools.
```

[These](https://landscape.graphql.org/category=graph-ql-adopter&format=card-mode&grouping=category) companies are using GraphQL. Very in demand!

## Graphs

Graphs are a powerful data structure. They consist of a set of nodes and edges which connect pairs of nodes. Here's an example:

## The benefits of RESTful routing

RESTful routes let us use a simple API for accessing/modifying data using HTTP requests (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, & PUT). REST has 6 architectual constraints:

* **Uniform Interface:** When a developer is familiar with one of your API's they are familiar with all of your APIs

* **Client-Server:** The client and server are seperate from one another. They can evolve independently.

* **Stateless:** The client manages state. Not the server!

* **Cacheable:** Caching is applied to resources to make application more efficient

* **Layered System:** The client cannot tell whether it is connected directly to the end system of some intermediary (enhanced security)

* **Code on demand:** Optional constraint. Lets server return executable code.
