## GraphQL

Their website says it best:

```
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime 
for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 
GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description 
of the data in your API, gives clients the power to 
ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it 
easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful 
developer tools.
```

[These](https://landscape.graphql.org/category=graph-ql-adopter&format=card-mode&grouping=category) companies are using GraphQL. Very in demand!

## Graphs

Graphs are a powerful data structure. They consist of a set of nodes and edges which connect pairs of nodes. Here's an example:
