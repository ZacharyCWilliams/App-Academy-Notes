## Redux Store

The store is responsible for:

   * Updating the apps state through it's reducer
   * Broadcasting the state to an applications view layer via supscribtion
   * Listening for actions that tell it how/when to change the global state 

## How to create the store

Use createStore:

```
createStore(reducer, [preloadedState], [enhancer]);
```

The reducer (required) is: 

```
a function that recieves the apps current state and incoming actions. This function determines how to update the stores state, and also returns the next state
```

The preLoadedState (optional) is:

```
an object respresenting app state that existed before store creation
```

The enhancer is:

```
a function that adds extra functionality to the store
```

## Redux Store API

   * getState() - Returns the store's current state.
   * dispatch(action) - Passes an action into the store's reducer telling it what information to update.
   * subscribe(callback) - Registers callbacks to be triggered whenever the store updates. Returns a function, which when invoked, unsubscribes the callback function from the store.




We dispatch an action to update the store
