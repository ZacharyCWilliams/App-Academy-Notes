## Redux Store

The store is responsible for:

   * Updating the apps state through it's reducer
   * Broadcasting the state to an applications view layer via supscribtion
   * Listening for actions that tell it how/when to change the global state 

## How to create the store

Use createStore:

```
createStore(reducer, [preloadedState], [enhancer]);
```

The reducer (required) is: 

```
a function that recieves the apps current state and incoming actions. This function determines how to update the stores state, and also returns the next state
```

The preLoadedState (optional) is:

```
an object respresenting app state that existed before store creation
```

The enhancer is:

```
a function that adds extra functionality to the store
```

## Redux Store API

   * `getState()` - Returns the store's current state.
   * `dispatch(action)` - Passes an action into the store's reducer telling it what information to update.
   * `subscribe(callback)` - Registers callbacks to be triggered whenever the store updates. Returns a function, which when invoked, unsubscribes the callback function from the store.

## How to update the store

We dispatch an action to update the store:

```javascript
store.dispatch(action);
```

A redux action is an object with a type key, and optional payload keys with additional info. Example:

```javascript
const addOrange = {
  type: "ADD_FRUIT",
  fruit: "orange"
};
```

Once a dispatch is called, the store passes both its state and the action being dispatched to the `reducer`. Here's an example of a reducer: 

```javascript 
export default const reducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_FRUIT":
      return [...state, action.fruit];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

## Subscribe to the store

Once store processes dispatch, it triggers it's subscribers. Subscribers are callbacks that can be added to the store through `subscribe()`

## Reducers

The store has a reducer function that updates its state. Here's an example:

```javascript
// fruit_reducer.js
const fruitReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_FRUIT":
      return [...state, action.fruit];
    case "ADD_FRUITS":
      return [...state, ...action.fruits];
    case "SELL_FRUIT":
      const idx = state.indexOf(action.fruit);
      if (idx !== -1) {
        // remove first instance of action.fruit
        return [...state.slice(0, idx), ...state.slice(idx + 1)];
      }
      return state; // if action.fruit is not in state, return previous state
    case "SELL_OUT":
      return [];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
};

export default fruitReducer;
```
